## Message from the Secretary General

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/images/people/kd.png" alt="Secretary General"> 
**Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors,**  
It is my distinct honour and pleasure to welcome you all to the Shishukunj Model United Nations 2018, as the Secretary-General of the conference. The fourth session of the Shishukunj MUN will be held at The Shishukunj International School, Indore from October 4 to October 7, 2018.

Our world today is endangered by countless issues ranging from terrorist infestations, economic recessions and seemingly unceasing exploitation, to environmental threats and international clashes. Many of the hopeful people have lost hope and consider destruction inevitable. Disheartened by the scales repeatedly tipping in favour of the influential, they optimistically turn to the future generations to change the world for the better.

One of the corollaries to Murphy's Law is that when left to themselves, things can go from bad to worse. It is imperative for the youth to resolve the global threats and problems before they amplify. Fortunately, the world houses a population of nearly 2 billion young minds, each with distinctive ideas and solutions to these problems. We, at the Shishukunj MUN, firmly believe that the youth is the biblical flood which will change the course of history, determine our fates and make the impossible possible. 
Shishukunj believes that Model United Nations conferences are an ingenious way to give the youth the chance to analyse and resolve worldly issues through intense negotiation and diplomatic deliberation to train the future world leaders. Shishukunj MUN embodies the ideologies behind internationalism and diplomacy to give the students a chance to learn versatile skills like problem resolution and interact with people from across the country.

The theme for this year’s conference is **Towards Ecology, Economy, and Equity** – an idea which perfectly exemplifies the principles behind youth empowerment and sustainable growth. In its fourth instalment, Shishukunj MUN brings to you 9 dynamic committees, each with an intriguing agenda selected while keeping in mind urgent issues that need to be addressed and the stimulants required to activate latent skills within the students. Shishukunj MUN is also proud to adopt the UN4MUN rules of procedure, which provide the exact simulation of the United Nations to the delegates. I am confident that with such a committed Secretariat, an industrious Bureau and a diligent organizing committee, the Shishukunj MUN shall be an incomparable success.

Besides that, Shishukunj MUN 2018 will also provide the delegates with opportunities to interact with famed activists and influential leaders to gain inspiration from and learn from their invaluable experiences.

Shishukunj MUN stimulates an academic cum extra-curricular experience for the delegates to enjoy and be inspired by. I sincerely hope that you will find our conference engaging and will leave with cherished memories and knowledge. 

I look forward to welcoming you in October!  
Warm Regards
