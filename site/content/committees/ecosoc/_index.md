## Letter from the Under-Secretary-General

<img class="headshot" src="/assets/images/people/oa.png" alt="USC: ECOSOC Affairs"> 
**Greetings!**  
I am Om Agarwal and I couldn’t be more excited to serve as the Under-Secretary-General: Economic, Political, and Social Affairs, for this year’s conference.

The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is one of the 6 principal organs of the United Nations System. It serves as a central forum for discussing international economic and social issues with a slight pinch of politics and works on all three pillars of sustainable development—economic, social and environmental. Hence, it is the principal platform for action related to sustainable development.

The council has a vital role in conducting studies, preparing conventions and making recommendations to General Assembly, states and specialized agencies. However, it cannot pass any political/military orders concerned with the national security of any member state.
Shishukunj MUN 2018 brings to you an array of committees like United Nations Environment Programme, Committee on Peaceful Use of Outer Space and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, where delegates are expected to construct a framework that ensures economic growth and social justice, increases environmental stewardship, and strengthens governance.
Shishukunj MUN has adopted the UN4MUN procedures which have been slightly amended to suit the requirements of the EPS committees. For instance, all EPS committees will be drafting a resolution and not a report. Besides that, we will also be having a closing plenary - a joint session of all three EPS committees, on the third day of the conference.

We welcome you to our conference and are thrilled to open a new chapter and create history with you.  
Best wishes  
**Om Agarwal**  
Under Secretary General: Economic, Political and Social Affairs
